# showcaseThis project is a simulation of acquisition algorithm using Matlab. This is a part of a real GNSS receiver project. The GNSS receiver need to be able to adjust parameters of acquisition to get the best performance. So this simulation was be done to find the best combination according to different signals.##The frame of the project is following:1. to create the carrier modulated by code with different code delay, dopper shift, noise, etc.2. to filter the input3. to do the acquisition##Files in the project:+ main.m:   initialization and acquisition algorithm   + input\_signal\_maker.m:  function to create the input signal+ local\_code\_maker.m:  function to create the local code + local\_code\_maker_filter.m:  function to filter the local code + quadrature1filter.m and quadrature2filter.m:  filters to do I,Q demodulation+ tap\_filter1 and tap\_filter1  coefficients  of the filters+ ca_code:  code chips of one period
